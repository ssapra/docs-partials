The BOSH layer that underlies <%= vars.product_name  %> generates `healthmonitor` metrics for all VMs in the deployment. 
As of <%= vars.product_name  %> v2.0, these metrics are included in the Loggregator Firehose by default.
For more information, see [BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-metrics) in <em>Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Release Notes</em>.
