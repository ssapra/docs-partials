## <a id="credhub"></a> Access BOSH CredHub

<%= vars.platform_name %> stores some of its internal CA and 
non-CA certificates in the BOSH CredHub credentials store.  
For more information, see [BOSH CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/credhub/#bosh).

To access the BOSH CredHub credentials store, you must retrieve 
credentials from BOSH Director and then use the credentials 
to log in to CredHub from the <%= vars.ops_manager_full %> VM.


To access the BOSH CredHub:

1. In the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. In the **BOSH Director** section, click the link to the **BOSH Commandline Credentials**.

1. Record the values for `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.<br>
  For example:

    ```
    {"credential":"BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=abCdE1FgHIjkL2m3n-3PqrsT4EUVwXy5
    BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 bosh "}
    ```
  The `BOSH_CLIENT` is the BOSH CredHub client name and the `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` is
  the BOSH CredHub client secret.

1. Following the procedure in
[Gather Credential and IP Address Information](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather)
to obtain the information needed to log in to the BOSH Director VM. Record the IP address for the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Director and the Director Credentials.

1. Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM by following the procedure in
[Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. From the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM, set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your BOSH
CredHub server by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
  Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM you recorded above.
  <br><br>
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 \
      --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate
  </pre>

1. Log in to CredHub by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub login --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:<br>
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` earlier in this procedure.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` earlier in this procedure.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub login \
    --client-name=ops_manager \
    --client-secret=abCdE1FgHIjkL2m3n-3PqrsT4EUVwXy5
    </pre>

## <a id="check"></a> Check Expiration Dates

You can check the expiration date for CA and <%= local_product_name %> certificates.

To check certificate expiration dates:

1. Log in to CredHub by following the procedure in [Access BOSH CredHub](#credhub) above.

1. Run the following command:

    ```
    credhub get -n CERTIFICATE-NAME -j | jq -r .value.ca | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A 2 "Validity"
    ```
    Where `CERTIFICATE-NAME` is the name of the certificate you are checking.<br /><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ credhub get -n /services/tls_ca -j | jq -r .value.ca | \
        openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A 2 "Validity"
    Validity
              Not Before: Jan 23 19:04:58 2019 GMT
              Not After : Jan 23 19:04:58 2020 GMT
    </pre>

    The above command retrieves the certificate from CredHub, decrypts it, parses its JSON structure,
    and finds its `Validity` properties.
    The expiration date for the certificate is the value of `Not After`.<br><br>

<% if local_product_name == "MySQL for " + vars.platform_name %>
1. If any of your certificates are about to expire or have expired, do one of the following:
  * **If your TLS certificates are about to expire or have expired,**
    do the procedures in [Rotate CA Certificates Manually](#tls) below.
    This rotates both the TLS certificates and the internal certificates.
  * **If only your internal certificates are about to expire or have expired,** do the procedure in [Rotate Internal Certificates ](#internal) below.
<% end %>

##<a id='tls'></a> Rotate CA Certificates Manually

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: This procedure assumes that you use only one foundation and do not have a WAN setup. 
For WAN setup, all of the <code>apply changes</code> steps will need to be applied to your entire WAN. Also, all certificates must
include SAN and CN entries.</p>

To manually rotate the CA certificate:

1. [Obtain or Generate a New CA Certificate](#obtainorgenerate)
1. [Add New Certificates to <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#addnewandold)
1. [Apply Changes](#applychanges)
<% if local_product_name != "RabbitMQ for " + vars.platform_name %>
1. [Rebind Your Apps](#rebind)
<% end %>
1. [Set New CA Certificate to /services/tls_ca](#setnew)
1. [Remove the Old CA Certificate](#remove)
1. [Apply Changes](#applychanges2)
<% if local_product_name != "RabbitMQ for " + vars.platform_name %>
1. [Rebind Your Apps](#rebind2)
<% end %>

### <a id="obtainorgenerate" class="no-quick-link"></a> Obtain or Generate a New CA Certificate

To obtain or generate a new CA certificate:

1. Do one of the following:
  * **If you have a TLS cluster,** obtain the CA (certificate authority) that signs its
certificate. You will add this to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings in the following section.
  * **If you use self-signed certificates,** generate a new self-signed certificate with a separate name
in CredHub. In this example we generate the new certificate with the name “/services/new_ca”:<pre class="terminal">$ credhub generate \
  --name="/services/new_ca" \
  --type="certificate" \
  --no-overwrite \
  --is-ca \
  --common-name="servicesCA"</pre>
 * **If you use an intermediate certificate signed by a root CA in credhub,**
generate a new certificate signed by the CredHub root CA:  <pre class="terminal">
$ credhub generate \
    --name="/services/new_ca" \
    --type="certificate" \
    --no-overwrite \
    --is-ca \
    --common-name="servicesCA" \
    --ca=/path-to-root-ca</pre>

1. Add the new certificate to <%= vars.ops_manager %> in the following section.

### <a id="addnewandold" class="no-quick-link"></a> Add New Certificates to <%= vars.ops_manager %>

To add new and old CA certificates to <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

1. Log in to CredHub.
1. Obtain the current CA with `credhub get --name=/services/tls_ca -k ca`.
1. Obtain the new CA, either from a pre-existing file, or from your new CredHub location using `credhub get --name=/services/new_ca -k ca`.
1. Make sure both ca values are pasted into **<%= vars.ops_manager %> -> BOSH Director -> Security -> Trusted Certificates**.
1. Make sure both ca values are pasted into **PAS tile -> Networking -> Certificate Authorities Trusted by Router and HAProxy**
1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="applychanges" class="no-quick-link"></a> Apply Changes

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: This procedure involves restarting
all of the VMs in your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment to apply a CA certificate. The
operation can take a long time to complete.</p>

To apply these changes, do the following:
 
1. Navigate back to the **Installation Dashboard**.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Expand errands.
1. Select the errand to upgrade all service instances. 
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

<% if local_product_name != "RabbitMQ for " + vars.platform_name %>
### <a id='rebind' class="no-quick-link"></a> Rebind Your Apps

If your apps do not use the trusted store to validate server certificates, you
must rebind apps to the service instance to receive the updated CA certificate.
Apps must be written in Spring to use the trusted store.

To rebind your app:

1. Stop your app by running the following command:

	```
	cf stop YOUR-APP
	```
	Where `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app.

1. Unbind your app from the service instance by running the following command:

	```
	cf unbind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	```
	Where:
	+ `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app.
	+ `YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your service instance.

1. Rebind your app to the service instance by running the following command:

	```
	cf bind-service YOUR-APP YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
	```
	Where:
	+ `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app.
	+ `YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your service instance.

1. Restage your app by running the following command:

	```
	cf restage YOUR-APP
	```
	Where `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app.

<% end %>


### <a id="setnew" class="no-quick-link"></a> Set New CA Certification to /services/tls_ca

To have all instances use the new CA Certificate:

1. Do one of the following:
  * **If you have an existing certificate,** obtain the CA certificate and private key file corresponding
  to the CA that you applied in the previous step. Then, run the following command:<pre class="terminal">
credhub set \
    --name="/services/tls_ca" \
    --type="certificate" \
    --certificate=PEM-PATH/root.pem \
    --private=CERT-KEY
</pre>
      Where:
      - PEM-PATH is the path to the `root.pem` file.
      - CERT-KEY is the private key for the certificate.
  * **If you have created a new self-signed or intermediary certificate in /services/new_ca,**
set `/services/tls_ca` to the new CredHub value `/services/new_ca` that you generated in the previous step:<pre class="terminal">
$ credhub get -n /services/new_ca -k ca > new_ca.ca
$ credhub get -n /services/new_ca -k certificate > new_ca.certificate
$ credhub get -n /services/new_ca -k private_key > new_ca.private_key
$ credhub set -n /services/tls_ca \
    --type=certificate \
    --root=new_ca.ca \
    --certificate=new_ca.certificate \
    --private=new_ca.private_key
</pre>

### <a id="remove" class="no-quick-link"></a> Remove the Old CA Certificate

After your apps have reconnected to service instances with certificates generated
by the new CA, remove the old CA certificate:

1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in <%= vars.ops_manager %> and click the **BOSH
Director** tile.

1. Click **Security**.

1. Delete the old CA certificate in **Trusted Certificates**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Navigate to the **Installation Dashboard** in <%= vars.ops_manager %> and click the **PAS** tile.

1. Click **Networking**.

1. Delete the old CA certificate in **Certificate Authorities Trusted by Router and HAProxy**

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id="applychanges2" class="no-quick-link"></a> Apply Changes

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning: </strong> This procedure involves restarting
	all of the VMs in your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment to apply a CA certificate. The
