    symptom: 'If developers report errors such as:
		<pre class="terminal">Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: instance does not exist`</pre>',

    cause: 'The instance might have been deleted.',

    solution: 'Follow these steps:
		<ol>
		<li>
		<p>
		Confirm that ' + vars.service_name_article_full + ' instance exists in BOSH and
		obtain the GUID CF by running:
		</p>
		<pre><code>cf service MY-INSTANCE --guid</code></pre>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>
		Using the GUID obtained above, the following BOSH CLI command:
		</p>
		<pre><code>bosh -d service-instance_GUID vms</code></pre>
		</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
		If the BOSH deployment is not found, it has been deleted from BOSH.
