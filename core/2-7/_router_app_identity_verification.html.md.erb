1. Choose how the Gorouter verifies app identity to enable encryption and prevent
misrouting under **Gorouter app identity verification**:
    * **The Gorouter uses TLS to verify app identity**: Enables the Gorouter to
verify app identity using TLS. This is the default option.
    * **The Gorouter and apps use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity**:
Enables your apps and the Gorouter to verify each other's identity using mutual
TLS (mTLS). This option disables TCP routing because app containers accept incoming
communication only from the Gorouter.

(../concepts/http-routing.html#consistency) in _HTTP Routing_.
