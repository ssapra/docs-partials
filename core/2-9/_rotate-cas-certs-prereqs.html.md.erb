Before you rotate certificates:

* You must reset any certificates that were manually set in CredHub on <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.6 and earlier to prevent them from being rotated with other certificates generated by CredHub. To find and reset any manually set certificates in CredHub, see [Reviewing Manually Set Certificates in CredHub](manual-credhub-certificate.html).

* You must have both <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.9 and <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) v2.9 or later to rotate CredHub-managed certificates with this procedure. If you have a version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> earlier than v2.9, you can follow this procedure to rotate certificates managed by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Then, to rotate certificates managed in CredHub, see [Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro](advanced-certificate-rotation.html).

* You cannot have <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) installed to rotate CredHub-managed certificates with this procedure. If you have <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, you can follow this procedure to rotate certificates managed by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Then, to rotate certificates managed in CredHub, see [Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro](advanced-certificate-rotation.html).
