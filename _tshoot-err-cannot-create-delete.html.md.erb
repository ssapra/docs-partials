If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">
Instance provisioning failed: There was a problem completing your request. Please contact your operations team providing the following information: service: redis-acceptance, service-instance-guid: ae9e232c-0bd5-4684-af27-1b08b0c70089, broker-request-id: 63da3a35-24aa-4183-aec6-db8294506bac, task-id: 442, operation: create
</pre>

Follow these steps:

1. If the BOSH error shows a problem with the deployment manifest, open the
manifest in a text editor to inspect it.

1. To continue troubleshooting,
[Log in to BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in)
and target <%= vars.service_name_article_full %> instance using the instructions
on [parsing a Cloud Foundry error message](#parse-error).

1. Retrieve the BOSH task ID from the error message and run the following command:

	```
	bosh task TASK-ID
	```

1. If you need more information, [access the broker logs](#access-broker) and
use the `broker-request-id` from the error message above to search the logs for
more information. Check for:
  * [Authentication errors](#auth)
  * [Network errors](#network)
  * [Quota errors](#quotas)
