If no logs are being emitted by the on-demand broker, check that your syslog forwarding address is correct in Ops Manager.

1. Ensure you have configured syslog for the tile.
1. Ensure that you have network connectivity between the networks that the tile is using and the syslog destination. If the destination is external, you need to use the [public ip](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-14/tile.html#public-ip) VM extension feature available in your Ops Manager tile configuration settings.
1. Verify that the Firehose is emitting metrics:
  1. Install the [`cf nozzle` plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/firehose-plugin)
  1. Run `cf nozzle -f ValueMetric | 
  grep --line-buffered "on-demand-broker/MY-SERVICE"` to find logs from your service in the `cf nozzle` output. 

If no metrics appear within five minutes, verify that the broker network has access to the Loggregator system on all required ports.
