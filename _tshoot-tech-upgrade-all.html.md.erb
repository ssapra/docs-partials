If you have made changes to the plan definition or uploaded a new tile into Ops
Manager, you may want to upgrade all <%=vars.service_name_article_full%>
instances to the latest software or plan definition.

<br>
The `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand does the following:

* Collects all of the service instances the on-demand broker has registered.
* For each instance the errand serially:
	* Issues an upgrade command to the on-demand broker.
	* Re-generates the service instance manifest based on its latest configuration from the tile.
	* Deploys the new manifest for the service instance.
	* Waits for this operation to complete, then proceeds to the next instance.
* Adds to a retry list any instances that have ongoing BOSH tasks at the time of upgrade.
* Retries any instances in the retry list until all are upgraded.

If any instance fails to upgrade, the errand fails immediately.
This prevents systemic problems from spreading to the rest of your service instances.

<br>
To run the errand, do one of the following:

- Select the errand through the Ops Manager UI and have it run when you click `Apply Changes`.

- Run the following command:

	```
	bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand upgrade-all-service-instances
	```
